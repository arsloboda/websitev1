                <p>My name is Alex Sloboda and this is my website. As you have likely noticed it's quite young and
                    a bit messy so please excuse its appearance while I tidy up.
                    I made this website for many reasons but mainly because I am the sort of person that likes to take on interesting
                    projects and learn new things. This site is an ongoing project that I have had in mind for quite a long time but,
                    like many other projects, I lacked the necessary combination of spare time and energy needed to take it on.
