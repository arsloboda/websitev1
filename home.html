                <header><h1>Me and My Website</h1></header>
                <p>My name is Alex Sloboda and this is my website. As you have likely noticed it's quite young and
                    a bit messy so please excuse its appearance while I tidy up. </br></br>
                    I made this website for many reasons but mainly because I am the sort of person that likes to take on interesting
                    projects and learn new things. This site is an ongoing project that I have had in mind for quite a long time but,
                    like many other projects, I lacked the necessary combination of spare time and energy needed to take it on. Till now.
                    There remains a great deal of work to be done and I have many ideas in mind for additions to the site but it is my
                    hope that you find something here that catches your interest and perhaps inspires you to go tackle some 
                    interesting project or question that you have had in your own mind for awhile! Also, if you happen to run into any
                    issues on the site or have any ideas for how things could be improved please do let me know. Continuous improvement
                    is something I believe everyone should strive for and I intend to make it a key theme of this site. Anyway, I hope you
                    enjoy your visit!
